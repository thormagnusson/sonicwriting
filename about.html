<p>This research will map and clarify a complex landscape of current developments in music technology research where boundaries between creating and listening, and between instruments and media are disappearing. New inventions are uprooting traditional approaches to the writing, playing and sharing of music, and this needs to be studied from a media theoretical perspective. The Sonic Writing project will explore how past techniques and design patterns found in the areas of instrument design, musical notation and sound recording are translated into digital media practices of musical expression.
