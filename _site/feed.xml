        <title>Arts Research Symposium at AlgoMech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.algomech.com&quot;&gt;Festival of Algorithmic and Mechanical Movement&lt;/a&gt; is taking place in Sheffield between 12th and 19th of November, 2016. With a wide reach into the diverse forms of art, the focus is on artistic engagement with the algorithmic and the mechanical (perhaps a humorous reference to software-hardware and mind-body dichotomies). A festival rather than a conference, the programme was packed with exciting and rather wonderful pieces of art, ranging from bio art through robotics to performance art of the algorithmic and the mechanical. The Sussex &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emutelab.org&quot;&gt;Experimental Music Technologies Lab&lt;/a&gt; was invited to run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miptl.org/site/performance/arts-research-at-the-festival-of-algorithmic-and-mechanical-movement/&quot;&gt;Arts Research Symposium&lt;/a&gt; as part of the festival. This was the festival’s “academic” face, a platform where researchers, artists and the general public came together for a dialogue about the role of algorithms and mechanics in the arts. I found the day very interesting, below I will retrace the programme as I remember it, in order to remember more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/algomechcoffee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AlgoMech Coffee&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Morning coffee before starting the proceedings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a presentations session, where people had 15 minutes to present their work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harlizius-klueck.de&quot;&gt;Ellen Harlizius-Klück&lt;/a&gt; began the session by presenting her work on weaving, mathematics and notation systems. A brilliant project that’s both technical, historical and philosophical, the hypothesis is that any historical period of human culture can be understood from the language related to its technical mode of existence. Metaphors derived from each historical period’s highest technology infiltrate its thought and language. For ancient Greeks that technology was weaving: metaphors from weaving would be used to explain the cosmos or the structure of the state. The project attempts to understand past thinking process via the technology of live coding weaving looms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://medialab-prado.es/person/jesus-jara-lopez&quot;&gt;Jesús Jara López&lt;/a&gt; presented work done at the MediaLab Prado in Madrid. The communal project &lt;a href=&quot;http://medialab-prado.es/article/autofabricantes&quot;&gt;Autofabricantes&lt;/a&gt; is a learning community for makers that focuses on building prosthetic objects. For example building robotic hands, or prosthetic hands, that might be used for humans, but designed by the person whose hand it will become. There is something beautiful about people designing their own bodily extensions, as a process of design, purpose and aesthetics. What came up in the discussion was that a person who has never had a left hand might not necessarily want a hand with five fingers on it, as the medical profession would automatically proscribe. They might want more fingers or less, or implements of any purpose and use: perhaps a modular system of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arandomprocessexperiment.blogspot.co.uk&quot;&gt;Susanne Palzer&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Access Space team, discussed the Open Platform project that she has been working on for some years. Susanne is interested in questioning technology, bringing it to people by deconstructing it in live performances, exploring how creative processes can form during a live performance. A form of live coding, the project aims to reconfigure technologies, or as she says, do “technology without technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://transmediale.de/content/alejandra-perez-nu-ez&quot;&gt;Alejandra Perez Nuñez&lt;/a&gt; presented her Yeast performance project. She focuses on the potential of yeast reactions as biological responses as part of more complex ecosystems. For Alejandra, her work is an onto-epistemological investigation where, through the sonification of the fermentation action of the yeast. Here the yeast has a form of knowing, a relationship with its owner, craving sugar or heat perhaps, but certainly set up as a node in a complex perceptual system. Barad’s intra-action was mentioned in this context, with the state external material properties becoming part of our sensory system via translation processes, such as sonification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eliseplans.net&quot;&gt;Elise Plans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/davidplans&quot;&gt;David Plans&lt;/a&gt; presented their generative music systems in the form of mobile app, the audiovisual Ominator. Here the user’s voice affects the development of the music and the visuals in realtime, so the listener becomes an integral part of the piece, fusing the listening with performance and composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muresearchlab.com&quot;&gt;Giuseppe Torre&lt;/a&gt; raised a question regarding the creative machine: where should we locate the real creativity when AI and computational creativity algorithms make it difficult for us to differentiate what art is made by a human and what by a machine (a theme explored brilliantly in the performance during the afternoon coffee break by Luba Elliott). Giuseppe presented his code art installation, AI Prison, which asks if a system can independently self-organise and evolve its own memory paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alejandroalbornoz.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Alejandro Albornoz&lt;/a&gt; presented the impressive work of Chilean pioneer in computer music and algorithmic composition, Jose Vicente Asuar. A visionary and an inventor, Asuar created computers in the 70s and released some works that are of historical interest, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTrmYWhvRk&quot;&gt;El Computator Virtuoso&lt;/a&gt; and Asi Hablo el Computador. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://pueblonuevo.cl&quot;&gt;Pueblonuevo&lt;/a&gt; for the music of Asuar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cargocollective.com/joanachicau&quot;&gt;Joana Chicau&lt;/a&gt; presented her choreographic work which focuses on arrangement of things in space (choreo - dance, but also space; graph - writing), and here, in particular, machine choreography. Joana impressively live coded in the browser, deconstructing the popular Google search page and turning into a choreographic space for exploring time, movement, and linguistic expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosasencis.org/&quot;&gt;Rosamaria Kostic Cisneros&lt;/a&gt; presenting a beautifully organised project which introduces new technologies to the traditional practices in Romani/Gypsy communities. Participatory design, community engagement and bottom-up technology design were the key concepts in this interesting project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/godfried.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Godfried-Willem Raes&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Keynote speaker Godfried-Willem Raes explaining one of his musical robots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we had a keynote by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logosfoundation.org/godfried/cv-god-eng.html&quot;&gt;Godfried-Willem Raes&lt;/a&gt;. A composer, performer and robot engineer, Godfried is a pioneer and a catalytic force in European modernist and contemporary music. Godfried’s talk was personal, humorous and very informative. He first gave a short personal history of how he ended up creating musical robots, and discussing why robots are interesting in the historical development of music technologies.  It’s clear from Godfried’s work that he takes his role as musician to be one of performer and a communicator. For him music technologies are means to communicate with the audience, and thus require a seductive power: they are rhetorical devices. Having worked in the 1960s on electronic instruments, for Godfried it became interesting to work on robots since they are acoustic (as apposed to synthetic), they demonstrate the sonic action, and they exceed the physical capabilities of the human (such as being capable of playing 88 notes on the keyboard at the same time, or with microsecond intervals, each ‘finger’ with a different velocity value). A brilliant presentation, which we’ll have online hopefully soon, but in the meantime, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEjPlGIFuOE&quot;&gt;Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@elluba&quot;&gt;Luba Elliot’s&lt;/a&gt; intervention, which involved audience engagement in performing a Turing-type AI test, where other members of the audience were the critics, we had two panels: The first one chaired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dy7dx.com/about-2/&quot;&gt;Derek Hales&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;b&gt;Speculative Hardware and Fictive Materialities&lt;/b&gt;, and the second one on &lt;b&gt;Maker Culture&lt;/b&gt;, chaired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepandshare.co.uk&quot;&gt;Amy Twigger Holroyd&lt;/a&gt;. The speculative panel was extremely rich in content and, fittingly, very speculative. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/people/teaching-staff/culture-and-enterprise/jamie-brassett/&quot;&gt;Jamie Brassett&lt;/a&gt; discussed how the future enters the present in design, &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewhugill.com&quot;&gt;Andrew Hugill&lt;/a&gt; presented how pataphysics is the science of impossible solutions and thus a pertinent methodology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/maya-oppenheimer-29581326&quot;&gt;Maya Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt; gave a presentation on her concept of dramaturgical devices, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.ac.uk/ourstaff/profile/index.php?staffid=756&quot;&gt;Spencer Roberts&lt;/a&gt; took us through a concept map of process philosophy and how it relates to future issues in design. The maker panel discussed how technological and cultural changes have created the conditions of an emphasised focus on making (something that the panel agreed was simply a condition of human existence). With &lt;a href=&quot;http://medialab-prado.es/person/jesus-jara-lopez&quot;&gt;Jesús Jara López&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birdandbee.co.uk/about/&quot;&gt;Ryan Patrick Morley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomtobia.com/#aboutme&quot;&gt;Tom Tobia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tamarjanemillen.flavors.me&quot;&gt;Tamar Millen&lt;/a&gt; the discussion was engaging and interesting, framed by two quotes provided by Amy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many practices of making can be considered a sort of ‘everyday resistance’, not just to a consumerist culture but also to a political system increasingly controlled by corporate interests and difficult for normal people to influence directly. (Amanda Williams and Joshua Tanenbaum)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a little more cynical sounding Csikszentmihályi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called ‘making’ in North America and Europe is, frankly, a luxurious pastime of wealthy people who rightly recognize that their lives are less full because they are alienated from material culture, almost all of which is products produced by corporate interests. Sadly, rather than address the problem, makers develop a hobby that solves the symptom for them, but if anything slightly strengthens the disease. (Chris Csikszentmihályi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Harmony installation by Ryan Patrick Morley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symposium ended in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://algomech.com/2016/#event12&quot;&gt;Millenium Gallery&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birdandbee.co.uk/harmony/&quot;&gt;harmonograph installation&lt;/a&gt; by Ryan Patrick Morley, and performances by Tom Mudd on one button, Tim Shaw and John Bowers with modular hauntology, Joana Chicau with machinic choreography, Simon Blackmore clapping a sinewave, and Ryan Kirkbride live coding his FoxDot system. Or did it end there? Perhaps it ended in the Rutland Arms pub, or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://access-space.org&quot;&gt;Access Space&lt;/a&gt;, with smoke machines and pop-up sound systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remembering Musical Organics at STEIM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a couple of beautiful spring days in May, a group of people came together for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonicwriting.org/steim.html&quot;&gt;Musical Organics Symposium&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steim.org&quot;&gt;STEIM&lt;/a&gt;, Amsterdam, to discuss the topic of new musical instruments. The aim was to question composition, performance, and instrument design in the context of our new materials: the processor-based meta-machines we use to build our expressive instruments. However, the symposium acknowledged that the “digital” didn’t appear from nowhere: our work continues research and development that has taken place for centuries across different musical cultures. For this reason, the practitioners and researchers invited to present at the symposium came from diverse interdisciplinary backgrounds. From a traditional violin maker to an electrical engineer, the range of expertise was, in itself, truly inspiring. Moreover, the participants also perfectly embodied the symposium emphasis on interdisciplinarity: that very violin maker conducts excellent research in digital sound modelling and the engineer is also a composer and instrument designer. Composers writing instruments, performers designing instruments live, improvisers notating in the form of code, software engineers performing on stage: the degree of fluidity between concepts and practices was immense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presenters at the symposium were: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tai-studio.org&quot;&gt;Till Bovermann&lt;/a&gt;, instrument designer and software engineer; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarahnicolls.com&quot;&gt;Sarah Nicolls&lt;/a&gt;, composer, performer and instrument designer; &lt;a href=&quot;http://hansjohannsson.com&quot;&gt;Hans Jóhannsson&lt;/a&gt;, violin luthier and instrument engineer; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlab.taik.fi/~korayt/&quot;&gt;Koray Tahiroğlu&lt;/a&gt;, musician and HCI researcher; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eavi.goldsmithsdigital.com/phd/adriana-sa1/&quot;&gt;Adriana Sá&lt;/a&gt;, interdisciplinary artist, performer and researcher; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/&quot;&gt;Andrew McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, electrical engineer and composer; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marijebaalman.eu&quot;&gt;Marije Baalman&lt;/a&gt;, live coder and installation artist; &lt;a href=&quot;https://petefurniss.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Pete Furniss&lt;/a&gt;, clarinettist, performer, software designer;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jr.home.xs4all.nl&quot;&gt;Joel Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, composer, technologist, philosopher;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halldorulfarsson.info&quot;&gt;Halldór Úlfarsson&lt;/a&gt;, luthier, product designer and maker; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samduffy.co.uk&quot;&gt;Sam Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, saxophonist, HCI researcher, theorist; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thormagnusson.github.io&quot;&gt;Thor Magnusson&lt;/a&gt;, a software designer, musician, writer. I’ve given people these “role descriptions” and I’m sure they would object to the categorisations (I already object to mine), but this is roughly how people appeared as actors with roles in the symposium. The symposium was open for registration and judging from the quality of the work of the 23 attendees who signed up for the day they could equally have been presenting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/steimpeople.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Musical Organics Symposium&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Pictures from the first day of the Musical Organics Symposium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the morning and afternoon of the first day listening to short presentations, where people contextualised their research with the symposium theme. In between and after the presentations, we had excellent performances by &lt;a href=&quot;http://stephaniepan.com&quot;&gt;Stephanie Pan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://modularbrains.net&quot;&gt;Stelios Manousakis&lt;/a&gt;, Marije Baalman, Koray Tahiroğlu, Adriana Sá, Till Bovermann, and Pete Furniss. Somewhere in-between that we found a time to discuss the issues that had come up during the day, with very useful input from the audience. The discussion explored the concepts of composition, of performance on new instruments, how we communicate what we’re doing with new technologies, how to compose for new instruments, what happens to tradition and or legacy when technologies are in such flux. We also discussed how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nime.org&quot;&gt;NIME&lt;/a&gt; (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) education might be designed - a topic we explored further in a workshop the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;second day&lt;/b&gt; consisted of diverse discussions and workshops. We began by considering themes emerging from the presentations and the discussions we had already begun. How can new instruments be introduced, maintained, and sustained in terms of use? How can they be documented and archived (related to this, Andrew McPherson and others ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/50604/nime2016_mcpherson_et_al.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; related to this at this year’s NIME conference)? It is one thing to document the successes, but we discussed whether we also need an instrument cemetery, a NIME junkyard, where the mistakes go for a documented rot! Some of the best scientific papers are ones describing hypotheses that turn out to be false - would NIME benefit from such a repository? Might this allow designers better access to ideas that have been tried in the past, so that they can build on them rather than repeat them? Could it be that at times we learn more from mistakes than successes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a discussion that went far and wide, we had open workshops: we discussed Halldor Úlfarsson’s plans for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halldorulfarsson.info/halldorophone5/about_halldorophones/index.html&quot;&gt;Halldorophone&lt;/a&gt; instrument and Hans Jóhannsson demonstrated his &lt;a href=&quot;http://hansjohannsson.com/rapidweaver%20export/page22/exp.html&quot;&gt;21st Century violin&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporates interesting physical modeling techniques. Sarah Nicolls presented her wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta_U-H0cfPc&quot;&gt;Moments of Weightlessness&lt;/a&gt; performance on her Inside-out piano. We then split into two groups, one designing instruments with paper and another discussing what an education in the are of NIME or DMI (Digital Musical Instruments) might consist of. The idea was to investigate if and how a musical culture, as the one we find around acoustic instruments, might appear around electronic and digital instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonic Writing Research Fellow, Sam Duffy, took part in the workshop designing instruments with paper, facilitated by Till Bovermann, which explored aspects of human-computer interaction, product design, and psychology. She said: “We stripped instrument design back to basics, exploring the auditory possibilities of materials and form possible from a single sheet of paper. This was an opportunity to reflect on my personal desire to connect acoustic sound with digital opportunities. This was a meditative process in a beautiful surrounding and we were able to consider aspects of the environment, such as the effect of the wind on the sounds produced by the structures we created.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the education workshop. We had an interesting discussion on what a NIME curriculum would consist of. How might musicians best be educated to become skilled performers of new musical works? Firstly, it is unlikely that such an individual would be a performer only. We found it more likely that they would be composers, instrument makers, and performers, all at once. Considering the interdisciplinary role, such an education would be equally practical and theoretical - experimental and reflective. An important part would be to understand electricity and computer chips. Here, new types of notation will be learned: those of electrical schemata and computer code. In practice that would require some Arduino or Bela programming, as well as learning computational thinking with tools such as Pure Data, SuperCollider or Web Audio API. Sensors, motors, actuators; resistors, capacitors, transistors: these are the compositional materials at hand. Human-computer interaction, product design, and psychology are important elements of this type of study too. Understanding the human body, ergonomics, interface semiotics, and of course the most important elements, those hardest to measure quantitatively:  creative expression and the beauty and fun of a musical instrument. We listed these areas as a necessary technical underpinning for creating instruments, composing new musical pieces, and to be able to perform older pieces (or recreated older instruments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed that we should not operate with dichotomies such as technical-musical, technical-compositional, or technical-theoretical: in this context the technical becomes compositional, and as live coding practice demonstrates, it is performative as well. Having fused such distinctions, we started thinking about the role of the body in acoustic instruments: the dexterity of the fingers, the human breath, the human limits for pulse (phrasing, rhythm) and gesture (starting, sustaining, stopping). How do these embodied parameters feature in electronic and hybrid instruments? Considering the body schemata and its limitations, the focus moves to mapping: how bodily gestures can be meaningfully translated to sound. And the idea of “meaningful” here also relates to how the audience can interpret what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meaningful performance cannot exist without music of some interest and value. A student of NIME would have knowledge of music and instrument design from a global perspective, they would understand acoustics, culture, history and design. But most importantly, what needs to be taught and trained is performance practice. What the instrument is for? How it is played? How it works in ensemble with other instruments? How the performer connects to other performers? Or to the audience? How much theory is inscribed in the instrument, how much freedom does the performer have? Who takes these decisions? Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grounded NIME education will consider creativity at all levels of practice. How precisely to implement the above as an educational programme is a matter of institutional support, course goals, local research and musical cultures, and the personal style of the tutors. But this will be an education that stresses the role of context, community, and communication in musical practice. It will train approaches to invention and innovation. But just as in any musical education, what can’t be taught is the art of making good music - it can only form the conditions for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, writing this blog post, I came across this old &lt;a href=&quot;http://steim.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/STIEM-wire.pdf&quot;&gt;The Wire article on STEIM&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it might interest some. I thank the wonderful people at STEIM for welcoming the Sonic Writing project for a residency at their great institution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Documenting Live Interfaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 3rd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&quot;&gt;International Conference on Live Interfaces&lt;/a&gt; was held at the University of Sussex in late June, 2016. This was the first international conference held at the newly refurbished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.attenboroughcentre.com&quot;&gt;Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts&lt;/a&gt; (ACCA), and the building proved to be an excellent location for such an event, with a large auditorium for performances and paper sessions, as well as smaller rooms, called “towers”, for workshops, installations and posters, and the ACCA café bar which opens out onto the lawns for workshops in the sunshine (between raindrops). The conference was organised by a team who are all members of the university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emutelab.org&quot;&gt;Experimental Music Technologies Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Live Interfaces conference focuses on the &lt;b&gt;use of technology in the performing arts&lt;/b&gt;: how technology becomes a prosthesis of the performer’s body - how it augements, amplifies and empowers performers, whilst, at the same time, constraining, reducing and abstracting the conception of what might be possible. Liveness is crucial here: due to its real-time application this is not a technology that can be interpreted, pondered over, or selected from, but rather the situated technology of the present, the immediate and the dexterous body - it’s the technology of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/iclipeople.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ICLI conference&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Pictures from ICLI performances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is never neutral: it enframes, encapsulates, engulfs. The philosophy of technology has given a solid account of how technology changes our work processes, our social structure, the way we think and even the way we evolve as humans (see the work of Marx, Heidegger, Ihde or Stiegler). However, we often hear statements where technology is described as an &lt;i&gt;add-on&lt;/i&gt; to artistic projects, a mere means to an end. Such narratives reduce technics to embodied knowledge, the &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; of things, as opposed to more theory-focussed accounts, the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; of things; a binary model introduced as early as Plato with his articulation of &lt;i&gt;techne&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;episteme&lt;/i&gt;. Consider, for example, the well-known account of composer Edgar Varèse calling for new instruments to express his new musical ideas. These ideas were clearly inspired by paradigm shifting developments in physics, relativity and mathematics. With electronic sound technology in its nascence, Varèse could begin to imagine the sounds of the future. The narrative has often been of Varèse as the visionary (or should we say “audionary”?) who was capable of imagining (or audioning) new sounds, and it was technology that was lagging behind his imagination (erm…). This is clearly an oversimplification as the theoretical work by Helmholtz on sound had already been published in the 1860s, largely derived from a technological framework of scientific instruments for measuring the properties of sound. We also find electronic instruments dating back to the 1880s, exemplifying the common truism that whenever a new technology emerges - such as oscillators, telecommunication, or computers - it will immediately be applied in the domain of music. Varèse’s thinking was already technologically conditioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICLI conference explored this symbiotic relationship between technology and artistic expression. It engaged with the complex loop of how materiality, interfaces, communication, and imagination relate; how the technological substrata presents itself as ideological frameworks, methods, aesthetics and prostheses of the human body. In order to study this relationship between new instruments and new artistic expression we invited Halldor Úlfarsson and Andrew McPherson - both instrument designers par excellence - to run two invited workshops, set up to explore such questions as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How do we compose for new instruments? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Can we redesign old instruments for new music? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What happens when familiar instruments gain new expressive scope?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When employing computational interface technologies in the performing arts, we face diverse problems related to how the audience interprets the role the technology takes in a performance. For example, should the technology be obvious and synchronous with performance gestures or hidden and part of the mystique of the artist? Topics of liveness, immediacy and presence, as well as mediation, signification and expression are critical and should be questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary technologies play in contemporary human expression. With the Live Interfaces conference series, we are interested in exploring the philosophy of interface design, and studying how performance technologies function in their diverse art forms, as well as how we use them to communicate our intention as performers on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is my quick attempt to document some of the thoughts emerging with me during this year’s ICLI conference, but there is also &lt;b&gt;proper&lt;/b&gt; documentation: the recently published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org/#proceedings&quot;&gt;ICLI 2016 proceedings&lt;/a&gt; contain information and the submitted pieces for the paper sessions, keynotes, doctoral colloquium, installations, workshops and performances. The proceedings have been published with &lt;a href=&quot;http://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/reframebooks/archive2016/live-interfaces/&quot;&gt;REFRAME Books&lt;/a&gt;. The conference was also documented on video, and most of the sessions can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZYaObEdMoIynz3d18nIinob2G_pL9iXZ&quot;&gt;Emute Lab’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Notations Symposium @ IRCAM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Sonic Writing research project, we are organising a symposium with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ircam.fr&quot;&gt;IRCAM&lt;/a&gt;, Paris, on September 22nd, 2016. Further information on the symposium website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonicwriting.org/ircam.html&quot;&gt;New Notations Symposium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus is on new notational practices in the context of recent developments in new instruments and media and key topics will address different aspects of musical instrumentalities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;notation and tradition - how does a notational language evolve?
&lt;li&gt;new instruments - how does the role of notation change with new technologies?
&lt;li&gt;the symbol and the material - do new ergonomic and timbral affordances require new symbolism?
&lt;li&gt;the evolving instrument - how do we compose for evolving technologies?
&lt;li&gt;notation in screen-based and computational media - what are the qualities of dynamic scores?
&lt;li&gt;graphic notation, live notation, animated notation - how does concept of &quot;liveness&quot; change?
&lt;li&gt;education and learning - how do we learn new notations for new digital instruments?
&lt;li&gt;audience understanding - how do we communicate what a notation system does?
&lt;li&gt;how does a notation system evolve, and how do we understand that evolution?
&lt;li&gt;what does a musical notation system mediate?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The symposium blurb:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonicwriting.org/ircam.html&quot;&gt;New Notations Symposium&lt;/a&gt; at IRCAM explores current notational practices in the writing for new instruments and media. The aim is to study the changes in notational strategies that are brought forward with new music technologies, where graphics, animation, and algorithmic techniques offer extended compositional possibilities. Musical notation and instruments evolve in parallel, and we find that in much contemporary work, the notation system becomes part of the instrument, or even an integral part of the musical piece itself. Processor-based media enable dynamic score systems that are applied to generate musical events in real-time or respond to instrumental performances in ways traditional media are not capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, with the increased analytical power gained with machine listening technologies, we find that auxillary notations of timbre, gesture, and affect become important aspects of the &quot;writing&quot; of a musical work. Contemporary composers study this potential of new notation, and this symposium looks into the design of new instruments from ergonomic and timbral perspectives and studies how musical notation develops in concert with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symposium topics include musical notation for new instruments, secondary notation, graphic or algorithmic notation, live and animated notation, usability, sustainability and legacy, tradition, issues of learning, audience communication, and more. The symposium consists of presentations, performances, and discussions. It is an open event, as long as space is available.

        <title>Machine Creativity Roundtable at IASPM in Brighton</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We present a roundtable on Machine Creativity as part of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaspm.org.uk/conference2016&quot;&gt;IASPM conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; co-organised by the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sussex.ac.uk/music/&quot;&gt;Sussex Music Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bimm.co.uk/brighton/&quot;&gt;BIMM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. The idea is to set up a dialogue between researchers of machine creativity and popular music to further understanding between the respective fields. Members of the round table are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elaine Chew&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~eniale/&quot;&gt;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~eniale/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Chew is a musician (pianist) and mathematician (operations researcher) who designs mathematical and computational tools to model, analyse, and visualise music structures: structures constructed in the process of listening, performing, composing, and improvising.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebecca Fiebrink&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/Rebecca_Fiebrink_Goldsmiths&quot;&gt;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/Rebecca_Fiebrink_Goldsmiths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fiebrink is an expert in machine learning and has created systems using neural networks that can quickly learn gestural and compositional styles of performers and composers. 

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrew McPherson&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/view/20095/dr-andrew-mcpherson&quot;&gt;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/view/20095/dr-andrew-mcpherson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How can computer algorithms add to and shape musical performance? Can instruments learn about the performers playing them? Can they contribute to the playing? Andrew will bring the NIME (New Instruments for Musical Expression) expertise to this round-table.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bob Sturm&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/&quot;&gt;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sturm’s research seeks to interrogate the “creative” and/or “intelligent” machine. Though a machine may appear creative and/or intelligent, what has it &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; learned to do? How can it be changed to do what we want it to do? Sturm will discuss various approaches to answering these questions, and how such &quot;learned machines&quot; can provide useful assistance and inspiration to the human creator.


&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thor Magnusson&lt;/b&gt; (chair) - &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/164902&quot;&gt;http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/164902&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thor Magnusson is a musician with a PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, focusing on music software and the role of computers in musical creativity. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;IASPM 2016 conference poster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for our roundtable is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;cite&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent academic fields such as software studies, digital humanities, and the philosophy of technology have directed focus on big data, machine agency, and the role of algorithms in contemporary culture. We are slowly gaining a clearer understanding of the power, as well as pitfalls, of machinic involvement in daily human tasks. With machines that learn and communicate, we will see their powers used in domains that were seen as exclusively human, for example artistic creativity. However, the use of computational creativity in the domain of music is nothing new and one of the earliest computer music compositions - the Illiac Suite by Hiller and Isaacson - was composed applying Artificial Intelligence techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine creativity in the creative process can range from minor &quot;suggestions&quot; in filtering or mixing, or intelligent mapping between a controller and a sound generator, to a stronger involvement where the computer aids in writing in the style of a certain genre or a composer, even composing a whole musical piece without any human involvement. This raises both technical and philosophical questions about the nature of composition, performance, and creativity in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposed round-table addresses recent developments in machine learning, musical corpus analysis, and related computational creativity techniques. The session includes specialists in  machine creativity, who will present and discuss diverse aspects of how computers will be more involved in the creative process of future musical works. The panel will explore the potential of computational creativity in the musical domain, ranging from the use of AI in musical instruments, musical corpus analysis for deeper understanding and regeneration of music, and the use of AI for non-human music. The potential of semantic audio techniques will be questioned for the domains of film music, game sound and other fields where music has a specific context-aware functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The round-table will also discuss the role of the listener when musical works become open for interaction. How do new computational playback devices, in the form of mobile media, enable the listener to become part of the creative process of generating the music? What do these new technologies afford to composers, and how will they use AI as part of the new compositional context? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be discussing questions of computuational creativity and machine learning, and hoping to open up a dialogue with specialist in popular music studies. Some of the topics discussed include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How is machine creativity being best applied in the field of music?
&lt;li&gt; Does machine creativity belong equally in performance and in composition/studio work?
&lt;li&gt; What is creativity? How does this concept operate in your field of research?
&lt;li&gt; Under which conditions can we declare a machine to be creative?
&lt;li&gt; What can a machine do that humans can&#39;t?
&lt;li&gt; Is there a difference in how computational algorithms would engage with established genres vs. experimental music?
&lt;li&gt; Wherein lies the art of music making? Will it perhaps always escape the machine?

&lt;p&gt;Our session will be at &lt;b&gt;1pm, on Saturday 10th of September&lt;/b&gt;. See full programme &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaspm.org.uk/iaspm/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IASPM_Brighton_Schedule.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Musical Organics: A Symposium on Instrument Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 5th, a group of people will meet at STEIM in Amsterdam at a symposium called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonicwriting.org/steim.html&quot;&gt;Musical Organics&lt;/a&gt;. The aim with the symposium is to question what instrument design means in the current age of new materials and media. Through a genealogical enquiry we hope to outline traces of design patterns that extend through histories of musical cultures, and observe how these are translated or transduced by the migration into the seemingly infinite space offered by digital media. The symposium features presentations by a violin luthier, an artist instrument maker, engineers, designers, live coders, composers, and performers. Common to all these people is an interdisciplinary approach that crosses professional boundaries, through a practice that reaches beyond the granularity of our current language. The new materialities require new languages.

&lt;p&gt;Traditional organology (the science of musical instruments) is a study of the history and classification of musical instruments. Diverse classification schemes have been proposed, extending back to the ancient Greeks, who proposed a three-fold system of wind, string and percussion instruments. These organologies are hierarchical, with diverse levels, classes and branches. Some of these systems are incredibly nuanced, for example Montagu and Burton&#39;s scheme that has the following tree structure: kingdom (all noise makers), sub-kingdom (airophones, chordophones, membranophones, and idiophones), super-phylum (e.g., struck idiophones), phylum, class, order, sub-order, family, sub-family, genus, species, sub-species, and variety. There is a clear inheritance here to the classificatory metaphysics we find in Aristotle&#39;s &lt;i&gt;categories&lt;/i&gt;, which later became represented by classical tree structure hierarchies, known in medieval times as &lt;i&gt;Arbor Porphyriana&lt;/i&gt; (or the Tree of Porphyry).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/arbor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Tree of Porphyry&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The classificatory philosophical tree of &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AArborLulle.jpg&quot;&gt;Lully&lt;/a&gt;, based on Porphyry&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Isagoge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common and well known organology is the system proposed by Sachs and Hornbostel in 1914. This system expands the early Greek one, and defines &lt;i&gt;idiophones&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;membranophones&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;chordophones&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;aerophones&lt;/i&gt;. This organology allows for a clear typological tracing down to the unique features of the individual instrument, where, for example, the numerical denominator of 111.242.222 would refer to sets of hanging bells with internal strikers (1 = idiophone; 11 = struck idiophone; 111 = idiophones struck directly; 111.2 = percussion idiophones; 111.24 = percussion vessels; 111.242 = bells; 111.242.2 = sets of bells; 111.242.22 = sets of suspended bells; 111.242.222 = sets of clapper bells). This classification system, with such a nuanced cataloguing of instruments, is clearly useful for museums, historians, anthropologists, and some musicologists (I say &#39;some&#39;, as there has arguably been a gap between Western organology and musicology, a symptom of the rift we find in phiosophy between &lt;i&gt;episteme&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;techne&lt;/i&gt;, as introduced by Plato). 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kirscher.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kirscher&#39;s Aeolian Harp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Kirscher&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fotothek_df_tg_0008349_Akustik_%5E_Schall_%5E_Harfe_%5E_Aeolsharfe_%5E_Windharfe_%5E_Musikinstrument_%5E_Saiteninst.jpg&quot;&gt;Aeolian Harp&lt;/a&gt; from 1684 is an example of an instrument that breaks traditional organologies, as acknowledged by Sachs and Hornbostel in the introduction to their original work&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1940, Sachs added the fifth category to the scheme, the &lt;i&gt;electrophone&lt;/i&gt;. This was in turn divided into three sub-categories: electric-action, electro-mechanical, and radioelectric. Other organologists have continued applying the electrophone category and developing it. But here is the problem: with digital media, we get a material substance of such a plastic and dynamic nature - due to the computer being a meta-machine - that the concept of electrophone is clearly becoming inadequate. The introduction of a category like &lt;i&gt;digitophone&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;digiphone&lt;/i&gt; would not solve many problems. The fact is that digital musical systems, as implemented in software for computers, integrated in hardware, or in the form of mobile apps, are so open and diverse, deriving their design patterns from an extremely heterogeneous sources of musical technics, that fitting them into genealogical trees of tradititional organologies is an unworkable task. This impossibility is amplified further by the fact that the digiphones (if we are to temporarily entertain that organological category) equally originate from the worlds of digital design, human-computer interaction, and computer games. Such an organology would therefore have to be a project of interdisciplinary and intermedia nature.

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, and instead of improved organologies, we organise a symposium on musical organics: an attempt at exploring and framing the ecosystems of musical technics as a reticulated web - one that hybridises older organologies, continually borrowing, referencing, appropriating, and representing the techniques incorporated in human movement. This would be a heterarchical organology - a contradiction in terms - and thus the symposium name of &lt;i&gt;Musical Organics&lt;/i&gt;, referencing soil, plants, flowers, or perhaps the ultra-famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnteiRO-XfU&quot;&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;. This move mirrors Umberto Eco&#39;s criticism of the dictionary in favour of the more organisationally flexible scheme of the encyclopedia.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Critical Music Technology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Teaching music in Higher Education, in particular musical practices that make use of computers as tools for performance and composing, one cannot help but notice how colleagues in diverse universities across the country complain about the received definition of &quot;music technology.&quot; This definition frames music technology as the production of music made with a specific set of equipment; a musical practice that excludes wider activities, such as note-based composition, live performance, audiovisual composition, or the non-linear music found in apps and games. Colleagues frequently report on how the first meeting with new students always involves an encouragement for a more open minded approach to musical composition and performance with new digital technologies. The question often asked is where this narrow concept of music technology originates from?

&lt;p&gt;We could attempt to find an answer by examining how the subject called &quot;music technology&quot; is taught in secondary education. Here, we become acutely aware of a rather narrow focus and it interesting to discover that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual&quot;&gt;Ofqual&lt;/a&gt; has recently forged a stronger separation in the subject criteria for Music and Music Technology. This is done by means of a definintion of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-a-levels/music-technology-2008.news.html?article=%2Fcontent%2Fdemo%2Fen%2Fnews-policy%2Fqualifications%2Fa-levels%2Fmusic-technology%2Fas-a-level-music-technology-subject-criteria-consultation-now-open&quot;&gt; criteria for Music Technology&lt;/a&gt; into four separate themes that have now been confirmed in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504470/First_Teach_2017_Part_1_-_decisions_document_including_sociology.pdf&quot;&gt; Ofcom document&lt;/a&gt; to be implemented in 2017. Now the four themes have become the following Assessment Objectives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate use of music technology to capture, edit and produce recordings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate use of music technology to create, edit and structure sounds to develop a technology based composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of music technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use analytical and appraising skills to make evaluative and critical judgements about the use of music technology&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a document published in January 2016, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504026/GCSE_A_level_reform_subject_content_government_response.pdf&quot;&gt;Reformed GCSE, AS and A level subjects&lt;/a&gt;, we read that government policy is to increase &quot;emphasis on theoretical, technical and scientific understanding&quot; (p.38) with more &quot;mathematics and technical content.&quot; The idea is to create a stronger identity and separation between Music and Music Technology as two distinct disciplines. This is achieved by removing &quot;content which overlapped with AS and A level music as this created a rigorous subject with its own distinct knowledge and understanding.&quot; And one wonders whether performance and composition are amongst the excluded content. 

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it is evident that musical performance, written notated music, the design of new instruments, generative music, music for the moving image, live coding, sound installations, or sound design and music for computer games are greatly under-represented. Not to mention musicological approaches. This is an education that focuses on a specific set of equipment, where the producer is a consumer of technologies that are beyond the user to adopt or change (unlike what we saw in the studio activities of George Martin or Lee Scratch Perry). Indeed, the Ofqual documents suggest that the curriculum is designed for a 20th century music industry that has now been superseded with a much more diverse, energetic, and interdisciplinary field. 

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say that all the work we do in higher education aiming to correct the gender imbalance in music technology degrees is not helped by this type of language. My experience is that a holistic language that includes references to creativity, performance, art, audience, culture, collaboration, and communication will attract a much wider demography than a language centred on equipment and scientific terminology. (An excellent study on diversity in music technology is Georgina Born and Kyle Devine&#39;s article &quot;Music Technology, Gender, and Class: Digitization, Educational and Social Change in Britain&quot; in the &lt;i&gt;20th Century Music&lt;/i&gt; Journal).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mixer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a mixer&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;A familiar &quot;music technology&quot; iconography.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above illustrates the need for some critical re-thinking of what music technologies actually are. The common connotation of “music technology,” involves plastic- or metal-surfaced equipment offering interaction through rotating knobs, sliders, or buttons, which are mapped to functionality represented on a screen of some sort. It is the space-ship interface for powerful control over sound. However, a quick etymology of the word “technology” clearly demonstrates that we are not discussing plastic gadgets here, but rather an embodied knowledge, skill or craft. The roots of the Greek word &lt;i&gt;technê&lt;/i&gt; is “wood,” but at the time of the early philosophers, it had begun to denote the craft of producing something out of something else. For Aristotle, &lt;i&gt;technê&lt;/i&gt; is an activity where the &lt;i&gt;“origin is in the maker and not in the thing made.”&lt;/i&gt; In his work Rhetorics, Aristotle uses the word “technology” to signify the “craft of the word” (techne and logos) as used in grammar or rhetorics, which is an inverse meaning to the later use signifying the knowledge (logy) of craft (techne). The word is not used much until the 17th century, which is when it enters the English language. At no point did the word signify objects, but rather the skill of doing things, as evidenced Marx’s Das Kapital: &lt;i&gt;“Technology discloses man’s mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.”&lt;/i&gt; Earlier in the same paragraph we read: &lt;i&gt;“Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature’s Technology,”&lt;/i&gt; and it is clear that he means the ways nature goes about its business. Bernard Stiegler defines technology as &lt;i&gt;“the discourse describing and explaining the evolution of specialised procedures and techniques, arts and trades”&lt;/i&gt; and encourages us to use the word in the manner we apply the words “psychology” or “sociology”.

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; music technology: we don’t buy it, own it, or use it. Thinking, designing, discussing, performing and composing are all acts of music technological nature. Musical instruments, musical notation, recording equipment and media players are the tools of music technology and represent the musico-theoretical framework of each culture. In this context we observe that musical instruments are indeed amongst the earliest human technologies. Possibly preceding fire and weaponry, we could speculate how early humans used rocks or sticks to hit other materials in order to define territories, communicate, or synchronise movements. Some of the oldest known musical instruments are flutes found in Germany (the &lt;i&gt;Hohle Fels&lt;/i&gt; flute) and Slovenia (the &lt;i&gt;Divje Babe&lt;/i&gt; flute), thought to be between 35,000 and 42,000 years old. Preceding those flutes would be generations of forgotten instruments in the form of rocks and sticks which might not even “look like” musical instruments at all, but they represent the music technologies of the time. 

&lt;p&gt;To do music technology thus involves studying the environment in which new music is produced, critically reflecting upon how musical practices are determined by the tools at hand, which, in turn, are also conditioned by what we do with them. But more importantly, it means to perform, improvise, collaborate and redefine equipment for new contexts and explore their musical limits. The history of the saxophone is a good example of how undefined a musical instrument can be at first, slowly gaining a function amongst different musical cultures such as military bands and jazz. In this context it is interesting to behold Attali’s statement that in &lt;i&gt;“music, the instrument often predates the expression it authorizes, which explains why a new invention has the nature of noise; a ‘realized theory’ (Lyotard), it contributes, through the possibilities it offers, to the birth of a new music, a renewed syntax.”&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A critical questioning of music technology implies the study of how our music technologies are conditioned by the complex interrelationship of aesthetics, science, culture, and equipment. We should embrace the fact that music techno-logy is the knowledge of the craft of music, and that craft has traditionally, for at least 40 millennia, been about performing music, about people gathering together to play, share, contribute, live the moment, and enjoy the unexpected. The design and use of a bone flute, a lute, a musical score, or a digital audio workstation are all good examples of music technology. Entering the 21st century, we bring all that baggage with us, but let&#39;s unpack it in the context of new musical practices - of new musical technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ICLI 2016: The 3rd International Conference on Live Interfaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miptl.org&quot;&gt;Music Informatics and Performance Technologies Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Sussex are organising the 3rd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&quot;&gt;International Conference on Live Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;. This biennial conference began at the University of Leeds in 2012, and was then held in Lisbon in 2014. We are very excited to be hosting the third instance of this fantastic conference in Brighton this summer, at the University of Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference website can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&quot;&gt;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICLI conference is an interdisciplinary summit that focusses on performance technologies in all artistic human activities. There are more bespoke conferences on new interfaces in music (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nime.org&quot;&gt;NIME&lt;/a&gt;), but ICLI is unique in that it aims to understand how the different art forms engage with concepts of interface, embodiment, live performance, improvisation and technical skill. We can learn much from each other as practitioners in the diverse art forms, and there was a bespoke need in creating this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to stress the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, we have invited keynote speakers from three distinct fields of practice: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinything.com/&quot;&gt;Kristina Andersen&lt;/a&gt; (music), &lt;a href=&quot;http://stuartnolan.com&quot;&gt;Stuart Nolan&lt;/a&gt; (magic), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://watermillcenter.org/residency/roman-paska&quot;&gt;Roman Paska&lt;/a&gt; (puppetry). We are hoping the diversity of topics listed in the call will encourage people from as diverse performing art forms as dance, puppetry, music, performance art, magic, computer games, comedy, visual arts, video art, and many more. The boundaries are fuzzy, of course, as some might argue that live interfaces are also used in expressive ways in martial arts, religious ceremonies, or gastronomy, to name but a few examples, but we will await decisions from our excellent reviewer team to define what kind of conference this will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference will include the potential for a strong public involvement, where people will be able to attend special events during the conference or getting a day ticket for selected days. The conference will be one of the first public engagement activities of the newly refurbished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sussex.ac.uk/acca/&quot;&gt;ACCA&lt;/a&gt; (Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts), and the event benefits from the strong support by its creative director, Paula McDermott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Some members of the ICLI team inspecting the conference location at ACCA (Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very excited about two resonating instruments workshops that will take place before the conference starts. During these workshops, composers and performers will be teamed up to study, compose and perform on two quite unique instruments: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halldorulfarsson.info/halldorophones/about-halldorophones&quot;&gt;halldorophone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/mrp.html&quot;&gt;Magnetic Resonator Piano&lt;/a&gt;. These sessions will be lead by the instrument designers Halldor Ulfarsson and Andrew McPherson, together with skilled performers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecila.org&quot;&gt;Alice Eldridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarahnicolls.com&quot;&gt;Sarah Nicolls&lt;/a&gt;. There will be other workshops during the conference, but those will be proposed through the submissions and go through our peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submissions has been extended to February 21st, so please consider submitting a performance proposal, a paper, a workshop, an installation or participate in the doctoral colloquium. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World: Launching the Sonic Writing Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This website will document research activities relating to a two-year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahrc.ac.uk&quot;&gt;AHRC&lt;/a&gt; funded fellowship starting on February 1st, 2016. The Sonic Writing research project aims to investigate the complex relationship between musical instrument design, musical notation, and phonography, in order to get a better understanding of how digital media transform these established musical practices. The transduction process that takes place when digital media become the prevalent platform for musical production, dissemination, and consumption is exciting, yet deeply problematic, as with the abundance of new techniques and social connectivity brought by the digital media, we also leave behind knowledge and practices that are not translated into the digital. Entailed in the digital is an abstraction and representation of reality, a process that is bound to exclude features, add new ones, and marginalise others. The question of how musical traditions can be preserved in digital media is a real and pressing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary output of the project is a book, &lt;i&gt;Sonic Writing: Technologies of Musical Expression Notation and Encoding&lt;/i&gt;, which will be published by Bloomsbury&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/academic/academic-subjects/music-and-sound-studies/&quot;&gt;Music &amp;amp; Sound Studies&lt;/a&gt; series. The research is conducted with five project partners: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ircam.fr&quot;&gt;IRCAM&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, &lt;a href=&quot;http://steim.org&quot;&gt;STEIM&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnmat.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;CNMAT&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley, &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/&quot;&gt;CMC&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk&quot;&gt;C4DM&lt;/a&gt; (Queen Mary) in London. These will host residencies where the research team will organise workshops and symposia on key research themes: instrument design, musical notation, phonography (including machine listening), and music in digital media. Workshops and symposia will be advertised here and on other media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is in many ways building on the experiences and knowledge gained from running the highly active &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livecodenetwork.org&quot;&gt;Live Code Research Network&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=&quot;http://yaxu.org&quot;&gt;Alex McLean&lt;/a&gt;. The past two years have been amazing and I thank you Alex for the wonderful collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will result in various outputs: software, papers, articles, symposia, an international conference (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org/&quot;&gt;ICLI&lt;/a&gt;), and a book. For news and updates on events, please follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/thormagnusson&quot;&gt;@thormagnusson&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching an extensive research project is exciting: feelings of anticipation, curiosity, and adventure coalseque with the agitation involving entering territories of the unknown. With me on the journey are two other research team members, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samduffysax.webspace.virginmedia.com/indexSamDuffySinger/Home.html&quot;&gt;Sam Duffy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexanderpeverett.com&quot;&gt;Alex Peverett&lt;/a&gt;, who are perfectly placed to make this journey both academically fruitful and fun. Here is to the next two years!&lt;/p&gt;
