        <title>ICLI 2016: The 3rd International Conference on Live Interfaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miptl.org&quot;&gt;Music Informatics and Performance Technologies Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Sussex are organising the 3rd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&quot;&gt;International Conference on Live Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;. This biennial conference began at the University of Leeds in 2012, and was then held in Lisbon in 2014. We are very excited to be hosting the third instance of this fantastic conference in Brighton this summer, at the University of Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference website can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&quot;&gt;http://www.liveinterfaces.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICLI conference is an interdisciplinary summit that focusses on performance technologies in all artistic human activities. There are more bespoke conferences on new interfaces in music (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nime.org&quot;&gt;NIME&lt;/a&gt;), but ICLI is unique in that it aims to understand how the different art forms engage with concepts of interface, embodiment, live performance, improvisation and technical skill. We can learn much from each other as practitioners in the diverse art forms, and there was a bespoke need in creating this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to stress the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, we have invited keynote speakers from three distinct fields of practice: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinything.com/&quot;&gt;Kristina Andersen&lt;/a&gt; (music), &lt;a href=&quot;http://stuartnolan.com&quot;&gt;Stuart Nolan&lt;/a&gt; (magic), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://watermillcenter.org/residency/roman-paska&quot;&gt;Roman Paska&lt;/a&gt; (puppetry). We are hoping the diversity of topics listed in the call will encourage people from as diverse performing art forms as dance, puppetry, music, performance art, magic, computer games, comedy, visual arts, video art, and many more. The boundaries are fuzzy, of course, as some might argue that live interfaces are also used in expressive ways in martial arts, religious ceremonies, or gastronomy, to name but a few examples, but we will await decisions from our excellent reviewer team to define what kind of conference this will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference will include the potential for a strong public involvement, where people will be able to attend special events during the conference or getting a day ticket for selected days. The conference will be one of the first public engagement activities of the newly refurbished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sussex.ac.uk/acca/&quot;&gt;ACCA&lt;/a&gt; (Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts), and the event benefits from the strong support by its creative director, Paula McDermott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very excited about two resonating instruments workshops that will take place before the conference starts. During these workshops, composers and performers will be teamed up to study, compose and perform on two quite unique instruments: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halldorulfarsson.info/halldorophones/about-halldorophones&quot;&gt;halldorophone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/mrp.html&quot;&gt;Magnetic Resonator Piano&lt;/a&gt;. These sessions will be lead by the instrument designers Halldor Ulfarsson and Andrew McPherson, together with skilled performers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecila.org&quot;&gt;Alice Eldridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarahnicolls.com&quot;&gt;Sarah Nicolls&lt;/a&gt;. There will be other workshops during the conference, but those will be proposed through the submissions and go through our peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submissions has been extended to February 21st, so please consider submitting a performance proposal, a paper, a workshop, an installation or participate in the doctoral colloquium. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World: Launching the Sonic Writing Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This website will document research activities relating to a two-year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahrc.ac.uk&quot;&gt;AHRC&lt;/a&gt; funded fellowship starting on February 1st, 2016. The Sonic Writing research project aims to investigate the complex relationship between musical instrument design, musical notation, and phonography, in order to get a better understanding of how digital media transform these established musical practices. The transduction process that takes place when digital media become the prevalent platform for musical production, dissemination, and consumption is exciting, yet deeply problematic, as with the abundance of new techniques and social connectivity brought by the digital media, we also leave behind knowledge and practices that are not translated into the digital. Entailed in the digital is an abstraction and representation of reality, a process that is bound to exclude features, add new ones, and marginalise others. The question of how musical traditions can be preserved in digital media is a real and pressing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary output of the project is a book, &lt;i&gt;Sonic Writing: Technologies of Musical Expression Notation and Encoding&lt;/i&gt;, which will be published by Bloomsbury&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/academic/academic-subjects/music-and-sound-studies/&quot;&gt;Music &amp;amp; Sound Studies&lt;/a&gt; series. The research is conducted with five project partners: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ircam.fr&quot;&gt;IRCAM&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, &lt;a href=&quot;http://steim.org&quot;&gt;STEIM&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnmat.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;CNMAT&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley, &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/&quot;&gt;CMC&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk&quot;&gt;C4DM&lt;/a&gt; (Queen Mary) in London. These will host residencies where the research team will organise workshops and symposia on key research themes: instrument design, musical notation, phonography (including machine listening), and music in digital media. Workshops and symposia will be advertised here and on other media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is in many ways building on the experiences and knowledge gained from running the highly active &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livecodenetwork.org&quot;&gt;Live Code Research Network&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=&quot;http://yaxu.org&quot;&gt;Alex McLean&lt;/a&gt;. The past two years have been amazing and I thank you Alex for the wonderful collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will result in various outputs: software, papers, articles, symposia, an international conference (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liveinterfaces.org/&quot;&gt;ICLI&lt;/a&gt;), and a book. For news and updates on events, please follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/thormagnusson&quot;&gt;@thormagnusson&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching an extensive research project is exciting: feelings of anticipation, curiosity, and adventure coalseque with the agitation involving entering territories of the unknown. With me on the journey are two other research team members, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samduffysax.webspace.virginmedia.com/indexSamDuffySinger/Home.html&quot;&gt;Sam Duffy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexanderpeverett.com&quot;&gt;Alex Peverett&lt;/a&gt;, who are perfectly placed to make this journey both academically fruitful and fun. Here is to the next two years!&lt;/p&gt;
