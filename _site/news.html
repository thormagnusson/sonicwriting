<br>Presenting research at a City University. The <a href="https://www.sparc.london/touch-symposium">Touching Sound Symposium</a> is a two-day symposium which "brings together researchers and practitioners from both a musical (composition, sound art, performance, improvisation) and non-musical background (landscape architecture, dance, computer science, visual arts) in order to develop this field of research, which remains underrepresented in the study of music and sound art practices".
<br>
<br>
During the symposium I also performed with classical guitarist Petur Jonasson.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Sonic Writing workshop at Lydgalleriet</strong></font> [ March 8th-12th 2017 ]

<br>Before the Borealis festival in Bergen, I will be working with author Bergsveinn Birgisson on a <i>Sonic Writing</i> workshop at <a href="http://www.lydgalleriet.no">Lydgalleriet</a> that focusses on topics related to this research. The workshop is offered to students at KIB (Kunst- og designhøgskolen i Bergen), Architecture, Creative writing (Skrivekunstakademiet i Hordaland) and The Grieg Academy (Griegakademiet). The workshop will explore the way we write with particular focus on sound. Abstract poetry like sound-poetry or after-language poetry, textual musical notation, algorithmic notation, secondary musical notation, sound poetry, concrete poetry, and graphic notation are all forms of writing that we will engage with during the workshop. We will make musical instruments, considering how their design is a process of writing. The workshop will be highly interdisciplinary - with participants from institutions of divergent practices - and we will consider approaches in thinking about writing sound, about composing instruments, writing algorithms, speaking notes, drawing sound.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</strong></font> [ April 4th - 5th 2016 ]

<br>Asked to write a provocation for the <a href="http://eim-live.our.dmu.ac.uk">Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</a> (or EIM-Live) network in Leicester. My talk will discuss changes in music consumption, hopefully with some critical responses. This is my provocation:<br><br>

Music is moving to the periphery of cultural experience. Unlike a few decades ago where music was a central cultural reference for young people, a source for identity and ideology, the focus has now shifted to more sense intensive media, where AI, immersiveness, collaborating crowds, and other new forms of cultural experiences are taking over. What we called music and released on media formats such as LPs and CDs is disappearing, rendering the rock-gig with the same cultural status as the opera (a dead art form to be preserved in bespoke museums). In this provocation I will describe how this is happening, and in so doing I hope to provoke and make people angry, skeptical, and reject my arguments. I might reject them myself.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</strong></font> [ January 29th 2016 ]

<br>The Sonic Writing research project started by participating in a wonderful symposium at Bournemouth University on the philosophy of technology in the domain of musical performance, called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interagency-in-technologically-mediated-performance-tickets-19600034230?aff=efbnreg">Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</a>. I presented a paper on questioning music technology and how technology should be seen as something we do, rather than something we buy.
 
<p>The symposium will be recorded and eventually uploaded onto the <a href="http://translatingimprovisation.com"> Translating Improvisation</a> project website.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>LCRN Day in Somerset House</strong></font> [ January 28th 2016 ]

<br>The last event organised under the two-year AHRC funded Live Code Research Network took place in the Somerset House in London. The day set out to plan the future of the network, which includes this year's <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org">ICLC</a>, which will be in Hamilton, Canada in October.
 
<p>The Sound and Music organisation for new music then hosted a <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/creativedata">Creative Data Club</a>, where we presented some live coding projects. The day ended with two live coding performances as part of the <a href="http://bigbangdata.somersethouse.org.uk"> Big Bang Data</a> exhibition.
