    <strong><font color="#006699">Notating the Non-Notateable: Digital Notation of Txalaparta Practice</font></strong>
    
    <p>This paper explores notation practices related to the ancient Basque musical tradition of the txalaparta. It presents the txalaparta practice, introduces the improvisational rules of txalaparta playing, and describes our attempts in creating notation systems for the instrument. Due to the nature of txalaparta playing, Common Western Notation is not a suitable notation, and we will present the notation system we have developed as part of the Digital Txalaparta project. This system captures the key parts of playing and could potentially serve for both playback and a rich documentation of what players actually perform.</p>
