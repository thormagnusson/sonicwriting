We are reaping the rewards from the hard work in our <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC project</a> this winter. Two workshops on creative coding with machine learning are coming out, both free and open to all. 

Our <a href="http://www.emutelab.org">Emute Lab</a> Sussex team is running a workshop on live coding language design for machine learning. We are about to launch our <b>Sema</b> live coding system for machine learning. The launc will take place just before our workshop on Sema, and registration is still open: <a href="http://www.emutelab.org/blog/Semaworkshop">Sema Workshop</a>
