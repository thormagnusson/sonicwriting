We are reaping the rewards from the hard work in our <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC project</a> this winter. We are introducing two educational projects on creative coding with machine learning, both free and open to all. 

Our <a href="http://www.emutelab.org">Emute Lab</a> Sussex team is running a workshop on live coding language design for machine learning. We are about to launch our <b>Sema</b> live coding system for machine learning. The public launch will take place just before our workshop on Sema, and registration is still open: <a href="http://www.emutelab.org/blog/Semaworkshop">Sema Workshop</a>

There is also a Creative Machine Learning MOOC set up with FutureLearn. People can sign up for the workshop called <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/apply-creative-machine-learning">Apply Creative Machine Learning</a> :
Discover the creative side of machine learning with this free course using hands-on examples.

In the FutureLearn MOOC is not on live coding but the general idea of creative coding using machine learning. We ask how machine learning can help in creative acts, how we might see it as yet another tool in our diverse toolbox of creative applications. Participants will gain understanding of the key principles of machine learning and how to apply these technologies in the production of new art.
