My book, Sonic Writing, was published a year ago. I've been surprisingly pleased with the reception of the book and to learn that people whose work I'm continually inspired by are praising the book, using it in their teaching and recommending as a required reading for lab members. The book would not exist without these people and I'm very glad that ideas are feeding back the other direction too. Here below I present a mix of interviews, presentations and reviews of the book I've participated in or been made aware of.
