<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</strong></font> [ April 4th - 5th 2016 ]

<br>Asked to write a provocation for the <a href="http://eim-live.our.dmu.ac.uk">Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</a> (or EIM-Live) network in Leicester. My talk will discuss changes in music consumption, hopefully with some critical responses. This is my provocation:<br><br>

Music is moving to the periphery of cultural experience. Unlike a few decades ago where music was a central cultural reference for young people, a source for identity and ideology, the focus has now shifted to more sense intensive media, where AI, immersiveness, collaborating crowds, and other new forms of cultural experiences are taking over. What we called music and released on media formats such as LPs and CDs is disappearing, rendering the rock-gig with the same cultural status as the opera (a dead art form to be preserved in bespoke museums). In this provocation I will describe how this is happening, and in so doing I hope to provoke and make people angry, skeptical, and reject my arguments. I might reject them myself.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</strong></font> [ January 29th 2016 ]

<br>The Sonic Writing research project started by participating in a wonderful symposium at Bournemouth University on the philosophy of technology in the domain of musical performance, called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interagency-in-technologically-mediated-performance-tickets-19600034230?aff=efbnreg">Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</a>. I presented a paper on questioning music technology and how technology should be seen as something we do, rather than something we buy.
 
<p>The symposium will be recorded and eventually uploaded onto the <a href="http://translatingimprovisation.com"> Translating Improvisation</a> project website.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>LCRN Day in Somerset House</strong></font> [ January 28th 2016 ]

<br>The last event organised under the two-year AHRC funded Live Code Research Network took place in the Somerset House in London. The day set out to plan the future of the network, which includes this year's <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org">ICLC</a>, which will be in Hamilton, Canada in October.
 
<p>The Sound and Music organisation for new music then hosted a <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/creativedata">Creative Data Club</a>, where we presented some live coding projects. The day ended with two live coding performances as part of the <a href="http://bigbangdata.somersethouse.org.uk"> Big Bang Data</a> exhibition.
