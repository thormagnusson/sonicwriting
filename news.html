<br>Before the Borealis festival in Bergen, I will be working with author Bergsveinn Birgisson on a <i>Sonic Writing</i> workshop at <a href="http://www.lydgalleriet.no">Lydgalleriet</a> that focusses on topics related to this research. The workshop is offered to students at KIB (Kunst- og designhøgskolen i Bergen), Architecture, Creative writing (Skrivekunstakademiet i Hordaland) and The Grieg Academy (Griegakademiet). The workshop will explore the way we write with particular focus on sound. Abstract poetry like sound-poetry or after-language poetry, textual musical notation, algorithmic notation, secondary musical notation, sound poetry, concrete poetry, and graphic notation are all forms of writing that we will engage with during the workshop. We will make musical instruments, considering how their design is a process of writing. The workshop will be highly interdisciplinary - with participants from institutions of divergent practices - and we will consider approaches in thinking about writing sound, about composing instruments, writing algorithms, speaking notes, drawing sound.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</strong></font> [ April 4th - 5th 2016 ]

<br>Asked to write a provocation for the <a href="http://eim-live.our.dmu.ac.uk">Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</a> (or EIM-Live) network in Leicester. My talk will discuss changes in music consumption, hopefully with some critical responses. This is my provocation:<br><br>

Music is moving to the periphery of cultural experience. Unlike a few decades ago where music was a central cultural reference for young people, a source for identity and ideology, the focus has now shifted to more sense intensive media, where AI, immersiveness, collaborating crowds, and other new forms of cultural experiences are taking over. What we called music and released on media formats such as LPs and CDs is disappearing, rendering the rock-gig with the same cultural status as the opera (a dead art form to be preserved in bespoke museums). In this provocation I will describe how this is happening, and in so doing I hope to provoke and make people angry, skeptical, and reject my arguments. I might reject them myself.
