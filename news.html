<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</strong></font> [ January 29th 2016 ]

<p>The Sonic Writing research projected started by participating in a wonderful symposium at Bournemouth University on the philosophy of technology in the domain of musical performance, called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interagency-in-technologically-mediated-performance-tickets-19600034230?aff=efbnreg">Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</a>. I presented a paper on questioning music technology and how technology should be seen as something we do, rather than something we buy.
 
<p>The symposium will be recorded and eventually uploaded onto the <a href="http://translatingimprovisation.com"> Translating Improvisation</a> project website.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>LCRN Day in Somerset House</strong></font> [ January 28th 2016 ]

<p>The last event organised under the two-year AHRC funded Live Code Research Network took place in the Somerset House in London. The day set out to plan the future of the network, which includes this year's <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org">ICLC</a>, which will be in Hamilton, Canada in October.
 
<p>The Sound and Music organisation for new music then hosted a <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/creativedata">Creative Data Club</a>, where we presented some live coding projects. The day ended with two live coding performances as part of the <a href="http://bigbangdata.somersethouse.org.uk"> Big Bang Data</a> exhibition.
