<p>The Sonic Writing project team is organising a symposium on musical instruments design at the central studio for the study of electronic instruments, <a href="http://steim.org">STEIM</a> in Amsterdam. The symposium includes 12 key presentations, 6 musical performances and plenty of discussions about musical instrument design. Find information about the <a href="https://www.sonicwriting.org/steim.html">Musical Organics </a> symposium on the website, and you are welcome to register and join us during the day.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Alternative Histories of Electronic Music</strong></font> [ April 14th - 16th 2016 ]

<p>I will be presenting a paper on generative music at the  <a href="https://ahem2016.wordpress.com">Alternative Histories of Electronic Music</a> conference. The conference is organised by James Mooney, in relation to the <a href="https://hughdaviesproject.wordpress.com">Hugh Davis </a> research project. See the <a href="https://ahem2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ahem-conference-draft-schedule.pdf">conference programme </a> for what looks like an excellent event.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</strong></font> [ April 4th - 5th 2016 ]

<p>Asked to write a provocation for the <a href="http://eim-live.our.dmu.ac.uk">Embodied Intelligence in Music – Live</a> (or EIM-Live) network in Leicester. My talk will discuss changes in music consumption, hopefully with some critical responses. This is my provocation:<br><br>

Music is moving to the periphery of cultural experience. Unlike a few decades ago where music was a central cultural reference for young people, a source for identity and ideology, the focus has now shifted to more sense intensive media, where AI, immersiveness, collaborating crowds, and other new forms of cultural experiences are taking over. What we called music and released on media formats such as LPs and CDs is disappearing, rendering the rock-gig with the same cultural status as the opera (a dead art form to be preserved in bespoke museums). In this provocation I will describe how this is happening, and in so doing I hope to provoke and make people angry, skeptical, and reject my arguments. I might reject them myself.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</strong></font> [ January 29th 2016 ]

<p>The Sonic Writing research projected started by participating in a wonderful symposium at Bournemouth University on the philosophy of technology in the domain of musical performance, called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interagency-in-technologically-mediated-performance-tickets-19600034230?aff=efbnreg">Interagency in Technologically-Mediated Performance</a>. I presented a paper on questioning music technology and how technology should be seen as something we do, rather than something we buy.
 
<p>The symposium will be recorded and eventually uploaded onto the <a href="http://translatingimprovisation.com"> Translating Improvisation</a> project website.

<p><font color="#b30000"><strong>LCRN Day in Somerset House</strong></font> [ January 28th 2016 ]

<p>The last event organised under the two-year AHRC funded Live Code Research Network took place in the Somerset House in London. The day set out to plan the future of the network, which includes this year's <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org">ICLC</a>, which will be in Hamilton, Canada in October.
 
<p>The Sound and Music organisation for new music then hosted a <a href="http://www.soundandmusic.org/creativedata">Creative Data Club</a>, where we presented some live coding projects. The day ended with two live coding performances as part of the <a href="http://bigbangdata.somersethouse.org.uk"> Big Bang Data</a> exhibition.
